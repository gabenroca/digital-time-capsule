                    <p><br>Born on January 31, 2002, Gabriel Roca is a twenty-one-year-old Filipino-American raised in the Bay Area. As the older middle child of three siblings, Gabriel cherishes his life with his big family and their silly dog, Ivy. He is an introverted, kind, and humble personality who loves being spontaneous and fun but is typically more mellow and laid back.<br><br>Growing up, Gabriel was an active kid who loved playing soccer and taekwondo. Despite his athletic activities, he always had a genuine interest in the arts and enjoyed staying creative and artistic. In high school, he enrolled in an animation program at SVCTE, where he gained knowledge and skills in creating animations, short films, sound, and storyboarding. Gabriel was also a student educator for elementary kids and was an active volunteer, hosting and organizing community events and festivals.<br><br>Currently, Gabriel goes to San Francisco State University, pursuing a degree in Visual Communications. He hopes to work in the tech and design field, ultimately aiming to live comfortably and be able to express himself through his work.<br><br>Outside of school, one of his aspirations in life is to explore the world and make unforgettable memories. As a teenager, his parents' interest in traveling gave him the lucky opportunity to travel around the world and experience the many cultures, beauty, and people along the journey. As of today, he has been to nineteen countries and eighteen states and hopes to go to many more in the near future. One of his favorite trips was a seven-state road trip with his family, where he got to see breathtaking views and explore some of America's beautiful National Parks. In general, he treasures making memories and aspiring to lead a life full of love and liberation. Importantly, Gabriel believes his best memories are just being around the people he loves the most.</p><br><br>
